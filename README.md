# barbell-weight-calculator
## Web project that calculates which and how many plates put on a barbell 

My first personal project with WebDev technologies! <br>
I dont know exactly how to use git so this probably gona be a mess

### Goals:
- [ ] ask the barbell weight and opt to include it
- [ ] let the user choose the plates weight
- [ ] restyle the project
- [ ] make a visual barbell with the weights
