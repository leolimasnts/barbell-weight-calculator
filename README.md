# barbell-weight-calculator
## Web project that calculates which and how many plates put on a barbell 

Check the project [**here**](https://leolimasnts.github.io/barbell-weight-calculator/)

My first personal project with WebDev technologies! <br>
I dont know exactly how to use git so this probably gona be a mess

### Goals:
- [x] Add a unilateral option;
- [ ] Let the user choose the plates weight;
- [x] Restyle the project;
- [ ] Make a visual barbell with the weights;
